# 4Ball-in-2-boxes
This is the Simulation of Ideal Gas Distribution in 2 boxes.
Here is plot the microstate along x-axis.
"1" repesent 4 particles in left box
"2,3,4,5" represent 3 particles in left box and 1 particles in right box
......
"6 to 12" represent 2 particles in left box and 2 particles in right box which most probable state of the state but they don't always occurs , most of the times system occurs the most probable state but not always.


"11 to 15" represent 3 particles in right box and 1 particle in left box

16 - represent 4 particles in Right box
